### Summary
Cool cassava before reheating, and pair with okra and bitter leaf. This slows sugar release and keeps the meal affordable.

### Visual Plate
Use a calabash bowl. Fill **half** with cassava fufu (cooled, then reheated). Add **one quarter** okra stew (thick). Add **one quarter** bitter leaf (stewed or lightly sautéed). One small ladle of groundnut sauce is optional.

### Prep Steps
1) Boil cassava fufu and let it cool in a clean pot for at least 12–24 hours.
2) Reheat gently before eating. Do not refry in oil.
3) Serve with thick okra stew and bitter leaf to slow sugar absorption.

### Pairings (Why)
- **Okra stew:** Viscous gel slows absorption.
- **Bitter leaf:** Adds fiber and can reduce post-meal spikes.

### Feasibility Notes
Markets in Makurdi typically have okra and bitter leaf in most seasons; refrigeration not required.

“Hello friend. To steady your sugar, boil cassava, cool it in a clean pot overnight, then warm it gently before eating. Fill half your bowl with cassava, and the rest with thick okra stew and a handful of bitter leaf. Do not fry the cassava. Drink clean water with your meal. This is simple, local, and good for your strength. You are doing well—keep going.”
