Using Streamlit is the smartest move for this project. Since your core logic is in Python, Streamlit allows you to build a professional, interactive web app in just a few dozen lines of code—no HTML/CSS required.

Here is a step-by-step roadmap to building your RSIP Nutrition Dashboard in Streamlit.

1. The App Architecture
In Streamlit, the app runs from top to bottom. You should structure it to feel like a Clinical Tool:

The Sidebar: Patient configuration (Literacy level, Socio-economic status).

The Main Panel: The "Meal Optimizer" where users select a staple and preparation method.

The Results: Dynamic charts showing the Glycemic Load and the Visual Prescription (The DALL-E image).

2. The Core Code Structure
You can save this as app.py. It integrates the Python logic we discussed earlier with Streamlit’s interactive elements.

Python

import streamlit as st
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from logic import calculate_localized_glycemic_impact # Importing the function we wrote

st.set_page_config(page_title="RSIP Nutrition AI", layout="wide")

# --- UI HEADER ---
st.title("🌍 RSIP Nutrition AI")
st.markdown("### Contextual Diabetes Management for Underserved Communities")

# --- SIDEBAR: PATIENT CONTEXT ---
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Patient Context")
    literacy = st.radio("Literacy Level", ["Low (Visual Instructions)", "High (Text & Data)"])
    income = st.select_slider("Income Level", options=["Subsistence", "Low", "Middle"])
    st.info("The AI will prioritize seasonal, low-cost pairings based on these settings.")

# --- MAIN: MEAL OPTIMIZER ---
col1, col2 = st.columns([1, 1])

with col1:
    st.subheader("Meal Selection")
    staple = st.selectbox("Select Local Staple", ["cassava", "white_maize", "yam", "millet"])
    prep = st.radio("Preparation Method", ["boiled_hot", "pounded", "boiled_and_cooled", "fermented"])
    pairings = st.multiselect("Available Pairings", ["with_leafy_greens", "with_beans"])
    
    # Run the logic
    result = calculate_localized_glycemic_impact(staple, 200, prep, pairings)

with col2:
    st.subheader("Glycemic Impact Analysis")
    # Plotly Gauge Chart for Safety Zone
    fig = go.Figure(go.Indicator(
        mode = "gauge+number",
        value = result['final_glycemic_load'],
        title = {'text': f"Safety Zone: {result['safety_zone']}"},
        gauge = {
            'axis': {'range': [0, 40]},
            'bar': {'color': "#123C69"},
            'steps': [
                {'range': [0, 10], 'color': "#d4edda"},
                {'range': [10, 20], 'color': "#fff3cd"},
                {'range': [20, 40], 'color': "#f8d7da"}],
        }
    ))
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

# --- THE VISUAL PRESCRIPTION ---
st.divider()
if literacy == "Low (Visual Instructions)":
    st.subheader("📸 Your Visual Meal Plan")
    # This is where you'd call the DALL-E API using the prompt function we wrote
    st.image("https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Visual+Plate+Instruction+Generates+Here", 
             caption="Example: Small portion of starch + large portion of greens.")
3. How to Deploy (The "Portfolio" Step)
Streamlit Cloud makes your app live in seconds.

Create a requirements.txt file: Include streamlit, pandas, plotly, and openai.

Push to GitHub: Put your app.py, logic.py, and requirements.txt in a new repository.

Connect to Streamlit Cloud:

Go to share.streamlit.io.

Connect your GitHub repo.

Crucial: Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to the Secrets section in the Streamlit settings so it can generate images securely.

4. Advice for Making it "Portfolio-Ready"
Add "The Science" Section: Use st.expander("How the RSIP Engine Works") to explain the concept of Resistant Starch. This proves you didn't just build a toy, but a scientifically grounded tool.

Use Sample Data: Since you might not want to pay for a DALL-E generation every time a recruiter clicks your link, you can cache images. Use st.cache_data to show pre-generated images for certain combinations to save on API costs.

Case Study Write-up: At the bottom of the Streamlit app, add a section about your Client (The WHO Consultant) and the specific problem you were solving for him. It turns the app into a "Business Case."

5. Why this is better than GitHub Pages for this project
Interactivity: Recruiters can move sliders and see charts update instantly.

Python Power: You can't run Python on standard GitHub Pages; you’d have to convert everything to JavaScript. Streamlit lets you keep your specialized nutritional logic in Python.

AI Integration: Streamlit handles API calls (like OpenAI) much more securely and easily than a static HTML page.

Would you like me to refine the "Clinical Explanation" text for the st.expander section so it sounds authoritative for your doctor client?
